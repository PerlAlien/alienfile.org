    <p>By <b>Graham Ollis</b> on 22 April 2015.</p>

<p><a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> has made a great deal of progress since last September when
Joel Berger turned over day to day development for the project to the
then newly created <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> team.  Weâ€™ve closed most of the major
issues and pull requests.  One remaining important issue will hopefully
be solved soon (I will get to that later; if you are an <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> user
you may want to skip to <b>The Future</b> below).  Stability and
reliability has improved to the point where it is good enough to be used
by real projects.  My own <a href="https://pl.atypus.org/pod/FFI/Platypus.html" class="module">FFI::Platypus</a> depends on <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> tech to
provide libffi, as an example.  Iâ€™d like to see some other projects take
advantage of <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> as well.</p>

<p>What have we fixed?  A number of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Builds on Microsoft Windows are now doable, thanks to integration
with <a href="/pod/Alien/MSYS.html" class="module">Alien::MSYS</a> that provides the necessary tools to build autotools
based packages</p></li>
<li><p>Relocation of library directories is now
supported, including support for DESTDIR and AFS</p></li>
<li><p>Support for 64 bit Perls in hybrid 32/64 bit environments like
Solaris</p></li>
<li><p>Integration with FFI and Inline based distributions</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Why?  A lot of XS developers when they use an external non-CPAN
dependency will take one of two approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bundle the dependency with the module</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::CheckLib" class="module">Devel::CheckLib</a> to find the library as provided by the operating
system</li>
</ol>

<p>These approaches are somewhat inflexible.  If you bundle the dependency
then you are increasing the bloat of your distribution.  The bundled
version may become out of date, allowing bugs and security issues that
have been fixed upstream to persist in your version.  It also may be
problematic for integrators.  One distribution developer confided in me
that his module was unlikely to be integrated into his distribution
because the bundled C code needed to be reviewed and documented for
legal issues that would not be a problem if the code wasnâ€™t bundled.
The distribution already provided the library as a separate package.</p>

<p>If you depend on the operating system to provide the library then you
have a moral obligation to instruct your user as to how to install that
dependency, which may be different on different platforms.  If the
dependency isnâ€™t a common one then you will likely not get any useful
feedback from cpan testers.  Downstream developers may be reluctant to
use your module as a dependency since it may not install reliably.</p>

<p>Alien defines a non-Perl or non-CPAN dependency so that it can be used
by your CPAN distribution.  <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> provides a base class that you
can use to easily construct these dependencies.  When properly
configured, an <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> based distribution will use the system
provided library, and if it canâ€™t be found, attempt to download from the
Internet and install it into a share directory so that it will not
interfere with any system packages.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href="https://pl.atypus.org/pod/FFI/Platypus.html" class="module">FFI::Platypus</a> depends on <a href="https://pl.atypus.org/pod/Alien/FFI.html" class="module">Alien::FFI</a> which will use the
system libffi if it is usually available, and if not it downloads and
installs it for you.</p>

<h3>The Future:</h3>

<p>The one remaining important issue that I mentioned above has to do with
the way packages are installed into the share directory.  Historically,
<a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> has installed packages into their final destination when the
cpan client (or user) runs the ./Build install command.  The problem
with this is that many cpan testers do not necessarily install the
modules, preferring instead to add the blib paths to the PERL5LIB.  The
work around for this was for <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> to attempt to detect such an
environment and install the package into the blib in just that
circumstances.  This has improved the reliability of cpan testers, but
it does mean that cpan testers installs for <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> based
distributions work in differently in a subtle way.</p>

<p>With recent advances in relocation of packages included in <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a>
we can now install into the blib and allow the installer to install
these files into the final location, just like normal Perl
distributions.  The current version just released today has this
capability, but is off by default to maintain backward compatibility.
In the next version 0.017 we plan to make this the default.  So if you
are the owner of an <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> based distribution, now would be a great
time to test this change in behavior.  You can do this by installing the
development version of <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> 0.016_01, or by explicitly setting
alien_stage_install to 1 in your Build.PL (or dist.ini the latest
version of the Alien <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla" class="module">Dist::Zilla</a> plugin also supports this option).
Here is an example of how <a href="/pod/Alien/LibYAML.html" class="module">Alien::LibYAML</a> was modified to explicitly set
this value:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rsimoes/Alien-LibYAML/commit/2dfe47c0acd33785039d1ad27072a16e4bed98d5">https://github.com/rsimoes/Alien-LibYAML/commit/2dfe47c0acd33785039d1ad27072a16e4bed98d5</a></p>

<p>You should also make <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> 0.016 a prerequisite for your
distribution.</p>

<p>If this new behavior is going to break your distribution in a way that
is not otherwise fixable, you can explicitly set alien_stage_install to
0, and the old behavior will be maintained, even when <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> 0.017
is released.  If you decide to do this, please contact the <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a>
team, as at some point we would like to deprecate and perhaps even
remove the old behavior.  Contact us on either GitHub:</p>
