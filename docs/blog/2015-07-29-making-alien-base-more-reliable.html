    <p>By <b>Graham Ollis</b> on 29 July 2015</p>

<p>The <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> (AB) team has done a number of things over the past
year with AB to make the installing packages more reliable.  For AB
based Alien developers who have created their own Alien::Libfoo this is
great because they get the benefit of more reliable installs when users
upgrade their version of AB without having to release a new version of
Alien::Libfoo.  Though largely backward compatible with version 0.005
(or perhaps further), modern versions of AB have also been given a few
interface enhancements that require changes in Alien::Libfoo in order to
benefit.  So if you are an AB based Alien developer, please consider a
couple of simple changes that you can make to make your distribution
more reliable.</p>

<h3>Use <code>%c</code> instead of <code>%pconfigure</code>.</h3>

<p>Long story short, the <code>%p</code> directive was intended to handle the
portability problem when running a command in the current directly.  On
Unix this requires a <code>./</code> prefix.  That won‚Äôt work on Windows.
Unfortunately, configure is usually a shell script and on Windows you
need MSYS (or something similar) to provide sh and friends.  Even if you
had MSYS, <code>%pconfigure</code> won‚Äôt correctly invoke configure on Windows,
because that isn‚Äôt how you run a shell script on Windows.  So back in
version 0.005 we added the <code>%c</code> directive to mean ‚Äúrun configure however
that works on this platform‚Äù.  If AB sees that you are using <code>%c</code> it
will also make sure that <a href="/pod/Alien/MSYS.html" class="module">Alien::MSYS</a> gets added as a build
requirement, if it is needed.  In many cases, adding Windows support for
your AB based Alien distribution may be as simple replacing
<code>%pconfigure</code> with <code>%c</code> and making AB 0.005 a prerequisite.</p>

<h3>Require Alien::Base 0.018 (or 0.021)</h3>

<p>In version 0.016 we introduced staged installs to blib, and in 0.018 we
made it the default.  This was a significant change so while believed it
shouldn't break any existing modules, out an abundance of caution, I
blogged about this a while ago, and included some of the technical
details:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/graham_ollis/2015/04/alienbase-past-present-and-future-upcoming-change-in-behavior-1.html">http://blogs.perl.org/users/graham_ollis/2015/04/alienbase-past-present-and-future-upcoming-change-in-behavior-1.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So far, this change has been pretty positive.  The upshot is that the
cpan tester installs work in the same way as regular installs that users
make.  This means that the results in your cpan testers matrix is more
reliable AND more representative as to how users are actually using your
module.  I strongly recommend that anyone using AB bump the required
version up to 0.018.  If your package doesn‚Äôt use pkg-config consider
requiring 0.021 which fixed a bug with system libraries that don‚Äôt have
a pkg-config .pc file.</p>
