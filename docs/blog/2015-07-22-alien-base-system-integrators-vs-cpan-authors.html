    <p>By <b>Graham Ollis</b> on 22 July 2015</p>

<p>Last week I promised (or threatened depending on your outlook) to talk
about <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> in the context of system integration and
distribution packagers.</p>

<h3>Philosophy:</h3>

<p>The philosophy for <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> has always been that the system
library should be used when it is available, and if not, the source code
for that library can be downloaded and installed for you.  My own
<a href="https://pl.atypus.org/pod/Alien/FFI.html" class="module">Alien::FFI</a> (isa <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a>) which provides
<a href="https://sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a>, and <a href="https://pl.atypus.org/pod/FFI/Platypus.html" class="module">FFI::Platypus</a> which
uses it is a good example of the success of this approach as you can see
from their respective
<a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=Alien-FFI+0.12">test</a>
<a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=FFI-Platypus+0.3">matrices</a></p>

<p><a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> is of course trying to keep everyone happy all of the
time, and everyone knows that is impossible.  System vendors complain
that <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> has too many dependencies.  Module authors fear that
using the system library will make it too hard to support their XS
modules since they could end up linking against almost anything.  These
perspectives frequently clash and it can be a challenge to maintain
empathy for other parties when they do.</p></p>

<p>Yes, <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> has a number of non-core dependencies that donâ€™t do
much when you simply end up using the system library.  On the other
hand, many of them, such as Capture::Tiny and URI are useful in their
own right.  In addition once youâ€™ve gone through the pain of providing a
package for <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> and its
dependencies you can use it again for other <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> based
distributions and the XS modules that use them without having to bug
their maintainers with patches.  If something in <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> doesnâ€™t
quite work with your build system, please notify us right away so that
we can fix it!  We donâ€™t hate you.  We just work in a different
environment that you and may be unaware of your pain.  As an example, we
added support for destdir (commonly used when creating Linux binary
packages) back in version 0.005.  I take responsibility for
unintentionally breaking that in version 0.017, since we didnâ€™t have a
test for destdir installs.  Thanks to feedback weâ€™ve fixed that and
added a test that will make sure that it doesnâ€™t happen again.</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, depending on the system library does have its challenges, and it
makes me personally uneasy to think about all the ways that something
could go wrong.  On the other hand there are also benefits to using the
system library, as they are usually optimized for the particular
environment and will more likely to have security patches applied.  It
is also good to keep in mind that nobody is asking you to support the
system library.  That is the responsibility of the system developer.  I
do ask that you not actively stand in the way of people who DO want to
support the system library.  If there are known bad versions,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Alien-Base/lib/Alien/Base/FAQ.pod#How-do-I-specify-a-minimum-or-exact-version-requirement-for-packages-that-use-pkg-config">there is a way to specify a minimum or specific library version</a>,
which should be good enough in most situations.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, itâ€™s good to assume good faith, until you can prove
otherwise.  Remember that for a CPAN author using M<Alien::Base> makes
developing and maintaining Alien distributions easier.  Remember that
for a system vendor, being able to maintain just one version of a
library saves time and reduces bugs.</p>

<h3>Technical:</h3>

<p>The rest of this entry includes some technical notes that may be useful
for system vendors, and those that are really interested in Alien.</p>

<p>I mentioned that destdir support was broken in 0.017 (it was fixed again
in 0.022).  Ironically in most cases you will actually not want to take
advantage of this feature, since it is only required when building the
library from source, rather than using the system library.  In the next
version of <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> I hope to have an interface to make it fail
when the system library cannot be detected.  This is usually what system
vendors who provide the library as a separate package will want.  If you
want to have some say in how this interface is exposed, now is an
excellent time to make yourself heard:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Perl5-Alien/Alien-Base/pull/135">https://github.com/Perl5-Alien/Alien-Base/pull/135</a></p>

<p><a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> based modules should almost never be a run-time
prerequisite with newer versions of <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a>, so long as they use
the <tt>alien_isoloate_dynamic option</tt>.  This is highly recommended
as long as your package can be built as a static library, which is
almost always what you want when you are building an Alien package from
source for XS.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: the remainder of this entry represents my opinions only, and
not those of the <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> team.  This is true for everything that
I write here, but in particular my last two points should be considered
either unsettled or controversial.</p>

<p>Perl usually has paths for architecture specific and platform
independent module files. <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> does not install into the
architecture specific directory by default, even though in most cases it
does install architecture specific files.  I am not entirely sure that I
agree this is right, but we werenâ€™t able to achieve consensus on
changing it.  There is now an option and an environment variable to
change this behavior. The reason you might want to install into the
architecture specific path is if you are installing to a non-homogeneous
environment such as AFS.  Another use case would be if you were creating
a system package for for a library that isnâ€™t otherwise provided by your
operating system, and will thus be built by the <a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> system
from source.</p>

<p>Finally, I feel there is some room for slimming the dependencies on
<a href="/pod/Alien/Base.html" class="module">Alien::Base</a> if people make the case.  If there are some prereqs that
seem unreasonable, please open a ticket on the project GitHub (I canâ€™t
guarantee that you wonâ€™t be the one to do the actual work so be careful
what you wish for).  As an example, now that <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Archive::Extract" class="module">Archive::Extract</a> has
been removed from the core, it might be worth investigating switching to
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Archive::Tar" class="module">Archive::Tar</a> (still in the core) which should work in most cases and
pulling in <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Archive::Zip" class="module">Archive::Zip</a> only when it is needed, which should cover
virtually all other cases.  The dependency on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Build" class="module">Module::Build</a> (MB) is
probably not too popular amongst its MB detractors.  At the moment I
donâ€™t see a good alternative, but I have some ideas on how to proceed if
this is important to you.</p>
